The dreaded IKEA food hall,541,rv4vpd,https://www.reddit.com/r/britishproblems/comments/rv4vpd/the_dreaded_ikea_food_hall/,123,1641225531.0,"I entered the detestable warren that is IKEA at 10am this morning for a simple click and collect.

Mistake #1: Agreeing to make the trip with both my partner and her mother.

The click and collect took around 15 minutes. Bish, bash, bosh! Let’s go home!

“But we’re here now, so we might as well have a look around. I’ll get lunch.”

Mistake #2: Accepting lunch.

Now, in case you hadn’t already guessed, I don’t have a particularly good relationship with IKEA. In my eyes it’s an endless den of debauchery where all morals and dignity are left at the door. But, since I’ve always whipped around as fast as humanly possible, I’ve never eaten there before. I’ve always heard people absolutely rave about their food. The hotdogs, the meatballs, the weird jam. Maybe this could make it all worthwhile.

Mistake #3: Optimism.

As I was herded into what seemed like some kind of school lunch hall, I was immediately assailed by the ungodly cacophony of children’s screams and frustrated parents. 

We shuffled slowly between the stainless steel barriers feeling like cattle off to slaughter, slowly moving forwards but seemingly going nowhere.

The repetitive chant of “No Tommy, you’re not having a fucking salmon fillet, it’s 6 quid! Now stand still!” Is still ringing in my ears.

We eventually reached the food troughs.

The poor woman behind the counter was once probably a happy person who enjoyed life. Unfortunately, being trapped in meatball purgatory had seemingly drained every last bit of her soul. As she slapped down the balls of meat, potato and peas onto the plate any remaining optimism vanished.

Verdict:

I don’t even know what the meal was like. The sensory overload was so great I can’t remember. Being chained to the ball pit in a Wacky Warehouse would have been a more relaxing experience.

It’s now 4pm and I’ve only just got home.

I need a big drink, but I’ve got work tomorrow.

TL;DR Don’t go to the IKEA food hall if you value your sanity.",2022-01-03 15:58:51

I asked her to move because she was blocking my gate and I couldn't get past to get my bike in.

""Oh, don't worry"" she says, ""I won't be long""

I tell her that I don't care, because it's cold and I want to put my bike away and get indoors.

She then has the cheek to ask whether I own the drive - obviously I answer yes, but she just shrugs and strolls off.  When I call after her she shouts back that I'm not very friendly. 

I eventually managed to half lift my bike round her car (not trying too hard not to scratch it).

Some people

**Additional:**. Well this took off unexpectedly.  

To clarify a few points - I live in a Yorkshire market town.  Our house is one of a number that front onto a hill, with a bend that descends to the river and crosses a bridge before entering the town proper.  None of the houses have front drives.

There is a narrow (essentially only allowing a single car through though it’s not one way) street (20 mph limit) that is at the back of the houses with a very narrow low pavement (in most places 24 inches or less).  Some properties have a small garage or more often have taken this down and fitted a drive (more a parking place off road) and taken their back garden wall back to accommodate this (which is what we did).  The kerb is so low that it’s pretty much “dropped” the whole length of the road.

Everyone else either parks as close to their garden wall as they can at the back, or parks out front.  Either is a little bit of a risk as rat runners sometimes use the back street to avoid some of the traffic during busy times, and one guy had the whole side of his car scraped by a rat runner, and someone parked out the front had a speeding driver smack into his car, which promptly burst into flames…

Having said all that, there is bags of parking on all the streets nearby, which I use if we’re expecting guests.

We look after grandkids on a regular basis - getting the buggy through would have been impossible which was partly why I was so cross.  In the end I did what any decent British chap would do.  I called after her to “bugger off”, put my bike away and hid in the shed for a bit, went indoors, made a cup of tea, huffed and tutted, told the wife what had happened, and carefully peeped out the back window to make sure she went - which she did, within the half hour.

**Extra Information**

Lots of people have made suggestions.  She was on my drive, and this is a legal loophole.   It’s not a criminal offence, and the Council have no powers to move the vehicle.  The police won’t move it either, and advise not to try to move it yourself.  Here is the RAC’s advice

https://www.rac.co.uk/drive/advice/legal/parking-on-someone-elses-driveway/

It is illegal to block a private entrance - but she didn’t actually do that.  Even if she had, I think she would have been long gone by the time the police responded (if they did at all)

I immediately brought it to the attention of a member of staff who I've known for ages and was friendly with. She apologised profusely and gave me an immediate refund.

Would you leave it at that, given the fact that I'd been eating there for so long with no previous issues? Or would you report the place to environmental health, or at the very least post a review online (tripadvisor, google etc, social media etc) to warn others and perhaps give the owners a kick up the arse?

Sent in my application (itself a pain after they asked me a list of tedious questions like 'what does good customer service look like?'). Heard back a couple of weeks later saying they were conducting a right to work check, could I upload some scans of documents? 

Fell at the first hurdle. I don't currently have a passport. I used to, but it expired and I've since moved house so I'm sure the old one is kicking around somewhere, but I have no idea where. Given the events of the past couple of years, and the fact I am short on cash, I haven't had any immediate plans to go travelling, so haven't applied for a new one. The other option is my birth certificate, which is at my parents' house (who are in the process of moving so chances are it's in a box somewhere). I'm 31, but I have moved around a lot and I've just left important documents like that with them - I've never needed them for myself so never been in a hurry to move them out. 

Contacted Tesco to ask them if they could accept my driving licence, national insurance number and proof of address as evidence that I exist and am who I am. Apparently not. 

I cannot be that unusual in not having a passport or immediate access to their birth certificate. I imagine this is actually quite a common situation. Just seems a really weird hurdle to jump through. I was kind of expecting it to be a case of checking that I have a clean driving licence and a quick interview and I could just get on and do some deliveries.",2022-01-12 18:14:38

Consumerism is ruining Britain.,136,ryg43f,https://www.reddit.com/r/britishproblems/comments/ryg43f/consumerism_is_ruining_britain/,105,1641584988.0,"Self explanatory post title. But I will enlighten:


I believe it is ruining the state of Britain, when business profit takes over the happiness and spiritual sanity of its citizens. 

With the corporate boom, and consumerist culture, Britain has declined.

Smaller, independent businesses have been replaced by large corporations. Local craftsmanship is a thing of the past. 

Manufacturing has been located abroad. British manufacturing is a thing of the past. 

Workers are slaves to technology and the corporation. Fulfilling work is a rarefied phenomenon.  

People fill an empty void with spending on false promises. Life is drained of spiritual satisfaction. It remains a self-sustaining cycle, endorsed by economics, adopted by the citizens. The old, gentrified upper class has been replaced by a corporate class of business. The middle and working classes feed the cycle of consumerism. Do they get rich? Not enough to feel fulfilled. They work to the grave, never knowing how to use the money earnt. Consumerism is a distraction to the real meaning and purpose of life. 

Many other problems persist in the name of consumerism, and many exist outside it. 

You don't have to agree with this and I'd be happy to hear why you think consumerism may be a good thing.

Is there a solution to the problems Britain faces today? What is the consensus?",2022-01-07 19:49:48

As the cashier was scanning my bottle of pre-made Negroni, my brother asked if I could pay for his lunch too and I said yes. The cashier then said that as we were together, she needed to see some ID. My brother gave her his, showing that he’s 22, but she said she needed to see mine too as we’re together. I said I don’t carry it with me as I never get ID’d and besides, I’m very clearly older than my brother who has just proven that he’s also old enough to drink! She still needed ID. I offered to show her a photo of my passport on my phone, she wouldn’t accept it. My brother suggested we go get our mum (59) to buy it for us but I pointed out that by the cashier’s logic, she’ll need ID too! 

The cashier wouldn’t budge and feeling myself beginning to boil with rage and not wishing to make a scene I decided to leave without it, cursing this country’s draconian attitude towards alcohol as I went.

To top it all off, I then had to go back in with my mother and buy the damn bottle. I’m 32. Oh and in case you’re wondering, neither of us got ID’d.

Every day, we go out and pick litter, twice a day minimum. The demons that masquerade as pupils just throw rubbish everywhere with no reprimands or rebukes.

But sometimes they get caught doing something naughty - and that's when they are given the only real punishment they ever really receive - doing part of the job that I am paid and contracted to do by the council: picking litter.

The teachers that mete out this punishment don't seem to realise (or care) about the implications of this: 1) that janitors get regarded as some kind of ex-con, a warning to children - ""you'll end up like that"", and 2) they are pushed to view honest outdoor work and looking after your community as a Bad Thing. No wonder the world's in a state.

Obviously, nobody cares that it might make us (working class) janitors feel demoralised knowing that our job is viewed this way by (middle class) teachers...

Why can't the kids at least do the other parts of my job as well? Unblocking shitty toilets, cleaning up puke, moving huge heavy parcels, etc? We could supervise with a cup of tea and feet on the desk... But still, I'd like my job to be treated with just a little bit of dignity and respect...

I notice how teaching is not a punishment - hell, even cleaning isn't. Just my job.

Or am I not alone? Who else's job is someone else's punishment?

Edit: I don't expect this post to be so popular - thanks so much to everyone for the varied responses and for the awards. I tried to thank everyone for awards personally, but I guess some were anonymous. In any case, thank you!

I'll be trying to bring this issue up with management, and we'll see what the outcome is. I'll need to tread carefully, because there's a history of janitor conflict in the school (not surprising!) I'll try to report back when I get a chance to bring it up...

I wouldn't hate it if it wasn't for my family though. They're obsessed with football it's all they ever talk about. If the TV is on in the house someone's watching football, if someone's playing a game it's fifa. Even most of the news they consume is football related. It honestly drives me mad. I've not got anything to talk to my family about as they only chat about football and family drama.

Anyway small rant over back to the real story. I'm being taken up yo uni to start my third year of my concept art course. After a 4 hour drive to get to my unis city my parents and I go to check into the hotel. Turns out they cancelled the hotel without telling us. We then search the city for hotels literally everywhere is booked up. Well shit. So as an last-ditch effort we went to my accommodation building. The door was unlocked and nobody was there. So fuck it we walk in. 
Few minutes later another student pops round the corner asks if we know what's going on. We don't know. My dad just says let's ""wait for the caretaker"" he never came. After a little bit my parents tell me to wait here and they'll go get something for us all to eat. So they leave. Just me and the other student now. The dude tries to make small talk and just goes ""so hey ummm what's your favourite team"" I just look him dead in the eyes and go ""I hate football"" came off a lot harsher then I meant it to I think it's just because I was exhausted from my parents arguing over the hotel situation for an hour in the car. Then I look at the dudes shirt. That shit literally says ""I ❤ football"" I cringe so hard at what I just said. For the next 20 minutes of waiting I'm just standing awkwardly infront of this dude not making a peep.

My parents get back. My dad breaks the silence and just talks about football with this dude and just goes yeah this son doesn't like football though bit weird right? 😕 bruh. Anyway since nobody is in the building we use the opportunity to check the room I am going to book into tomorrow for my accommodation. Its unlocked. We bring up all my stuff I set up my gaming pc and my parents fall asleep on the bed behind me. I had to stay up as there is no way we're all fitting on that bed. I just watch movies until the morning. I watched The Green Mile for the first time. That shit made me tear up like a fucking baby.

Dawn breaks they leave to go back home and I sleep.  I see that dude every now and then over the year each time more awkward then the last. I genuinely feel I hurt him when I said I hate football.",2022-01-17 06:50:00

Is bitterness what you call flavor? Gold is even worse in that sense, completely inedible without milk.

Except Yorkshire I buy Twinings from time to time, their afternoon tea and Assam are quite nice, earl grey is good as well if I feel like drinking it. Recently I bought a pack of Tetley because it was ridiculously cheap, not gonna lie, it makes a decent cuppa.

I must have been looking at my wife for no more than 30 seconds when a lady with a trolley between me and my wife asked me passive aggressively if ‘i had a problem’. Truthfully I hadn’t noticed her and was looking through /passed her; I didn’t originally register that she was talking to me. 
As I was wearing a face covering and she wasn’t I can only conclude that she felt I was trying to make some sort of point. 
I stated that in fact I was waiting for my wife who was standing almost directly behind her; she walked off rather hawkishly without apologising; honestly, who pissed on her chips?

I'm a junior doctor, not a criminal. I used my own debit card, thats connected to my own home address for delivery. I'm quite upset at the way they dealt with it and made me feel like a fraudster. Have never had any problem with any other company. Seriously, what the fuck just happen?

Please see me right…..

My fixed energy plan is about to end next month. 
I’ve been enjoying roughly:

16p Elec and 3p Gas per KWh😎🕺🏼
For as long as I care to remember 

British Gas have just offered me:

32pE and 7pG per KWh
Fixed until 2024😰

Or, I can just slip onto the variable rate, currently at:

20pE and 4pG per KWh. 

I will not hold anyone liable, but….
What do you think I should do?
hang on until April and then wing it?
Get fixed now before things get worse? Will they really get worse than that!?

More importantly….
What’s everyone else doing?

If I sign up for the fixed, I’ll be expected to pay approx £4k+ per year😅👍🏻🤷🏼‍♂️🤔",2022-01-24 23:11:27

I don't think I could survive a full festival of it, just one night with enough lasers to make your eyes bleed, enough smoke to make your nose bleed and enough bass to make your ears bleed.

Something about being outside appeals to me, but the idea of going into a club is  not something I want. And, so many clubs Ive been to just play tracks one after the other without any of the good mixing. Low skill dj who can just about sync the beats together.

Probably, the reality of it would probably make me want to leave after half an hour.... ""It's too loud and rhere is too much weed smoke"" :-)
